        <h1>Welcome to the Rymate Server</h1>

<p>Like the new website design? I sure do. And in fact, the site isn't the only thing that's had a redesign. The entire server as been completely overhauled. Let me run through a few of the changes...</p>

<h2>More anarchy, less rules</h2>

<p>There was one thing people enjoyed about the anarchy period. It was <strong>FUN</strong>. There was very little rules, nothing to stop you making whatever you wanted, whether that was TNT traps or other things. However there was still griefing, so there is be some protection. In order to stop people just mindlessly blowing up buildings, <a href="http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/creeperheal-nitnelave/">CreeperHeal</a> is used. This allows you to mindlessly blow up buildings, but you can be assured that the plugin will roll-back building damage over time! :)</p>

<p>Also, there are less rules. PvP and stealing are now allowed, as is TNT. This means that you can now break into your enemies secret base and steal his stuff whilst he's not around. Or maybe you want to take revenge on EvilPlayer123 stealing your crops by blowing up his pigs.</p>

<p>However, griefing is still banned, and any deliberate damage to other people's property that wasn't due to tnt will get you banned. So, the rules are now simple.
1. Respect Staff
2. Don't grief
3. No Hacks
Follow those 3 rules, and you stay. Its simple really :)</p>

<h2>Less plugins</h2>

<p>In order to create an almost lag free Minecraft experience + more fun, I have kept the server plugins to a minimum. There are still plugins, but less of them. In my opinion, there isn't enough vanilla-like servers out there. There's lots of McMMO/Factions servers, and there is also lots of RPG servers. But I'm pretty sure people would like a simple, vanilla-like server. That's what I've tried to achieve with this server. There are still commands like /home, and /spawn, but I've aimed to keep the experience as simple, but as fun as possible.</p>

<p>And if you REALLY want to create a faction, go ahead. No-one's stopping you manually running a faction yourself. Want to trade? Go ahead, trade items! You don't NEED economy plugins or faction plugins to have factions/trading.</p>

<p>Some of the plugins on the server might even be edited slightly. For example, I'm using a modified version of <a href="http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/bchatmanager/">bChatManager</a> that allows you to switch between local chat and global chat.</p>

<h2>Other Stuff</h2>

<h3>Smaller spawn</h3>

<p>Why have a complex spawn when you can have a small, but functional welcoming hut with rules, some basic commands and an easy to find exit!</p>

<h3>NO WHITELIST</h3>

<p>NO WHITELIST. NEVER AGAIN. Having a whitelist was a stupid idea. </p>

<h3>Simpler groups</h3>

<p>We have a new group structure. The new group structure has only 4 groups, and gives trusted players slightly more powers! The structure is as follows
Default -&gt; Trusted -&gt; Staff -&gt; Owner
The reason? More equality. I felt that admins were pestered lots, whilst mods were just sitting there thinking "uhhh. I AM HERE YOU KNOW." Not anymore! :3</p>

<h2>And that's it!</h2>

<p>So that's a basic low down of the main changes to the server that you, as a player, have to know about. I hope you consider joining the server at <strong>rymate.dyndns.org</strong> and joining today!</p>

<h2>Wait, I CAME FOR A BLOG. AND FORUMS. NOT INFORMATION ABOUT THE SERVER.</h2>

<p>Oh, them. The forums are at <a href="http://rymatemc.co.uk/forums">http://rymatemc.co.uk/forums</a> and the blog can be found at <a href="http://rymatemc.co.uk/blog">http://rymatemc.co.uk/blog</a></p>
